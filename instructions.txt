Using the results from assignment 3, make sure that the following are included:

- Create a user table with a username and login and level
    - level is a character varying for length of 1
        - holds M or U
        - M - Manager
        - U - User
- Create view to add a user
    - Input for user name and password
    - Radio button group for Manager or User
    - Save button
        - when record is saved, return to landing page
    - Back button
- Modify landing page
    - Only show Add button if user is Manager
    - Add Delete button for each user in the table in the grid
        - If delete is clicked, display pop up message confirming
        - If yes, delete
        - If no, don't delete
        - Both return to the landing page
    - Add Edit button for each user in the table in the grid
        - When clicked, pass the user id to new Edit view
- Modify Add view
    - Only display if logged in
    - Don't worry about checking for Manager
- Create Edit view
    - Route receives user id
    - Finds user and displays in edit view
    - Allows changes
    - Button to save changes
        - Then returns to landing page
    - Button to go back to landing without saving
- There needs to be a login page so you know the type of user (manager or user)

NOTE: (this should be a culmination of all the group work you have done but I want you to do it now individually)

Make it look professional. This should be a full-stack website with database and security to display, add, edit, and delete data.
